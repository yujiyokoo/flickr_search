# flickr\_search

# Overview

This is an example application for flickr search using Rails.

To run it locally, please set `FLICKR_KEY` and `FLICKR_SECRET` environment variables.

To search, please enter your keyword(s) and press 'Search'.

If any result is found, they will be shown on the resulting page with each of them linked to their respective detailed view pages.

# Known bugs

The pagination shows too many pages.

Some pages (often past 20 or so) may be blank.

Pages towards the end seem to have the same content as the first page.
